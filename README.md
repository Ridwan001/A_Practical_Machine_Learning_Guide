A Practical Machine Learning Guide and Improving the Performance of a Machine Learning Model.

Churn prediction is a common use case in the machine learning domain. If you are not familiar with the term, churn means “leaving the company”. It is very critical for a business to have an idea about why and when customers are likely to churn. Having a robust and accurate churn prediction model helps businesses to take action to prevent customers from leaving the company.

In this post, we aim to build a supervised learning algorithm to perform a classification task. The goal is to predict whether a customer will churn (i.e. exited = 1) using the provided features.
